# Python-RPS-Program

This is a quick and fairly simple RPS (Rock, Paper, Scissors) game in Python.

The program operates within two 'while' loops and  begins simply by obtaining a user's name and welcoming the user
and linking the name wherever the user's name is mentioned e.g. Welcome Text. Then the program prompts the user 
by asking whether they want to play (y/n):

- if a user selects "y", the program proceeds
- if a user selects "no", the program ends with a message

As the program proceeds the user is prompted with the choice to pick between rock, paper, and, scissors;
the CPU will randomly select its own choice within the tuple named "options". The program will then output
both chosen choices into the terminal and also determine the winner; allocating a point to the player or
CPU's score respectively. Finally, after all this, the user is asked whether they want to play again (y/n):

- if a user selects "y", the loop returns back to "Enter a choice:"
- if a user selects "n", the program ends with a message saying goodbye and showing the scores

All parts of the code have error handling to ensure that the user does not break the program.
